            We made a commitment some time ago,
            That together through life we were destined to go.
            We purchased our furniture, linen and bedding,
            In the fulfilling years leading up to our wedding.
            What the future will hold for now is unknown,
            So what would be great is a nest egg of our own.
        </div>
